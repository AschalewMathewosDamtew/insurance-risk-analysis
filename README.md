# EDA Analysis - Week 3

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis performed during the first week of our project. The focus is on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, which includes various aspects such as data summarization, quality assessment, and visualization.

## Branch: `task-1-eda-visualization`
This branch includes the following analyses:

### 1. Data Summarization
- Reviewed the data structure and types of each column.
- Calculated descriptive statistics and variability for numerical features like `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`.

### 2. Data Quality Assessment
- Checked for missing values to ensure data integrity.

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Plotted histograms for numerical columns to observe value distributions.
- Created bar charts for categorical columns to understand their distributions.

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Explored correlations between `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims` using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
- Analyzed trends in insurance cover type and premiums over geography.

### 5. Outlier Detection
- Used box plots to identify outliers in numerical data.

### 6. Visualizations
- Produced three key visualizations to capture insights from the EDA, focusing on vehicle age, premium distribution by vehicle type, and average premium by cover type.

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `task-1-eda-visualization` branch.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells to view the analysis.
